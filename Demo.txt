1. Console.table([a,b,c]): Where "console.log(a)" is use for printing single value in console, "console.table([a,b,c])" is use for printing table in console.
2. If you create a variale in javascript and did not define it then it will be printing undefined in console.
3. If you use console.log() and console.table() in same line then it will be printing both in same line.
4. "use Strict" is used when we treat All JS code as a new version.
5. When we convert 1 to boolean then it will be printing true and 0 to boolean then it will be printing false also if we convert Empty string to boolean then it will be printing false also if we convert null to boolean then it will be printing false.
6. In javascript we have toFixed() method to convert number to fixed point. (console.log(balance.toFixed(2)) & if balance has any dacemal value on it then it will be printing 1234.56).

8. In javascript we have toPrecision() method to convert number to precision. (console.log(balance.toPrecision(2)) & if balance has any dacemal value on it then it will be printing 1.2e+3).
9. In javascript we have toLocaleString() method to convert number to locale string. (console.log(balance.toLocaleString()) & if balance has any dacemal value on it then it will be printing 1,23,456.78) and if we want to convert number to locale string in specific language then we have to use toLocaleString() method with language code. (console.log(balance.toLocaleString('en-IN')) & if balance has any dacemal value on it then it will be printing 1,23,456.78).
10. In javascript we have toString() method to convert number to string. (console.log(balance.toString()) & if balance has any dacemal value on it then it will be printing 123456.78).
11. In javascript we have toTimeString() method to convert number to time string. (console.log(balance.toTimeString()) & if balance has any dacemal value on it then it will be printing 12:34:56.78). 
12. In javascript we have Math.abs() method to convert number to absolute value. (console.log(Math.abs(-10)))
13. In javascript we have Math.ceil() method to convert number to ceil value. (console.log(Math.ceil(1.2)))
14. In javascript we have Math.floor() method to convert number to floor value. (console.log(Math.floor(1.2)))
15. In javascript we have Math.round() method to convert number to round value. (console.log(Math.round(1.2)))
16. In javascript we have Math.max() method to find max value. (console.log(Math.max(1,2,3)))
17. In javascript we have Math.min() method to find min value. (console.log(Math.min(1,2,3)))
18. In javascript we have Math.pow() method to find power value. (console.log(Math.pow(2,3)))
19. In javascript we have toLocaleString() method and in this method we can change the timezone. (console.log(new Date().toLocaleString('en-IN', {timeZone: 'Asia/Kolkata'}))).
20. In javascript we have unshift() method to add element in start of array. (console.log(arr.unshift(1,2,3))).
21. In javascript we have push() method to add element in end of array. (console.log(arr.push(1,2,3))).
22. In javascript we have shift() method to remove element from start of array. (console.log(arr.shift())).
23. In javascript we have pop() method to remove element from end of array. (console.log(arr.pop())).
24. In javascript we have concat() method to add element in end of array. (console.log(arr.concat(1,2,3))).
25. In javascript we hava includes() method to check element is present in array or not. (console.log(arr.includes(1))).
26. In javascript we have indexOf() method to find index of element in array. (console.log(arr.indexOf(1))).
27. In javascript we have lastIndexOf() method to find last index of element in array. (console.log(arr.lastIndexOf(1))).
28. In javascript we have array and init array we have join() method which is use for joining array. (const newArr = arr.join();) and also this method will change the array value to string.
29. In javascript we have array and init array we have reverse() method which is use for reversing array. (const newArr = arr.reverse();).
30. In javascript we have array and init array we have slice() method which is use for slicing array. (const newArr = arr.slice(1,3);) in this we are taking 1st element from array and 3rd element from array and 3rd element is not included in new array and also the original array is not changed.
31. In javascript we have array and init array we have splice() method which is use for splicing array. (const newArr = arr.splice(1,3);) in this we are taking 1st element from array and 3rd element from array and 3rd element is included in new array and also the original array is changed.
32. In javascript if we want to add more then 1 array with each other so in that case we use concat() method
33. In javascript we have spride operator (...) which is use to concatinate the array elements and in this operator we can more then two arrys at a time like const newArr = [...arr1, ...arr2, ...arr3] for example const arr1=[10,20,30], const arr2=[40,50,60], const arr3=[70,80,90], const newArr = [...arr1, ...arr2, ...arr3] then newArr will be [10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90].
34. In javascript we have filter() method which is use to filter array elements based on condition like const newArr = arr.filter(item => item > 20) in this it will filter all elements greater then 20.
35. In javascript we have flat() method which is use to flatten nested arrays like const arr = [0, 1, 2, [3, 4], 5]; const flatArr = arr.flat(); // [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] in this we have to give depth also if nested more then 1 like arr.flat(2);
36. In javascript we have symbol datetype, we can create symbol using Symbol() function like const id = Symbol() and if we want to use Symbol within Object so we do like this first we declare a Symbol then add that Symbol to Object like const id = Symbol('Keys'); const usr = { [id]: 'John Doe' };
37. In javascript we have freeze() method to freeze object and its properties, so it prevents new properties from being added to it and prevents existing properties from being deleted and their attributes changed. const user = {name: 'John', age: 30}; Object.freeze(user); user.name = 'Jane'; // Throws an error
38. In javascript we have seal() method to seal object and its properties, so it prevents new properties from being added to it, but it does not prevent existing properties from being deleted or changed. const user = {name: 'John', age: 30}; Object.seal(user); user.name = 'Jane'; // Works fine
39. In javascript we have Object.assign() method to copy properties from one object to another. const user = {name: 'John', age: 30}; const admin = Object.assign({}, user, {role: 'Admin'});   // {name: "John", age: 30, role: "Admin"}
40. In javascript we have Switch statement, we can use Switch statement to check multiple conditions and perform different actions based on the condition. const user = {name: 'John', age: 30}; switch (user.age) { case 30: console.log('Hello John'); break; case 25: console.log('Hello Jane'); break; default: console.log('Hello Stranger'); } if we have 4 conditions and the 2 condition is correct and we did not put break key word in last 2 case so it will also exiqute but not default, default will not be exiquted.
